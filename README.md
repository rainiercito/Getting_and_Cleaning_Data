Getting_and_Cleaning_Data
=========================

Course project for Getting_and Cleaning_Data module

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This Github folder has three files: (i) CodeBook.md file which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data. (ii) A README.md file which explains how the script work and how the required files are connected, and (iii) run_analysis.R script file that does the following: 


- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject  


The run_analysis.R script must use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and 
appropriately labels with descriptive variable names.
